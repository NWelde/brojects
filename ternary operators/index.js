let age = 21;
let message = age >= 18 ? "you are an adult" : "you are a minor ";  /* a ternary operator is just like a if statment but its easier to write is is only useable in samll conditions what its doing
here is if age>=18 == true it assigns the first message to the variable but if the condition is false it assigns the second one and the way its structured is let x = x>5 ? "true":"false"//**** */
